 This is an example script to segment an ellipse from image.
 The ellipse in image is represented by some dots that has an ellipse pattern.
 this script using optimization algorithm to detect most likely ellipse region.
 The fitness is formulated as summation of those dots.
 This scripst using cuckoo search as main optimization algorithm.
